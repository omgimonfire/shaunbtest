PROXYSG

Production
github.com is allowed in Shared Object > Allowed URL List with SSL
This was added by Mark Tugbo in an old change (S158279) 
This is allowing everyone to access github.com and other github.com links

Option 1.
If we remove github.com from Allowed URL list with SSL this will prompt user to request for user proxy access via getit (Service: GitHub User Proxy Access)
(currently no members exist in this github allow group as above rule is bypassing - do we need this?)

Option 2.
Changes made in QA:
1. Add github.com/login to banned_URL_list
2. VPM - disabled Github user proxy access under web access layer
3. removed github user proxy access from deny_restricted_catagory
(this will allow anyone to get to github.com and disallow them from accessing github.com/login)

Tested:
Pushed Policy
tested github.com - allowed
tested gitrhub.com/community - allowed
tested github.com/login - blocked
